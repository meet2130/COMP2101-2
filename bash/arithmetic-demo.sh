# this script demonstrates doing arithmetic

# Improve this script by asking the user to supply the two numbers
# Improve this script by demonstrating using subtraction and multiplication
# Improve this script by demonstrating the modulus operation
#   - the output should look something like:
#   - first divided by second gives X with a remainder of Y
# Improve this script by calculating and displaying the first number raised to the power of the second number

#Varaiables and data
